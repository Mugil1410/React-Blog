# React Blogify App

## Description
I've developed **Blogify**, a dynamic blog app using React. Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts by entering titles and descriptions. Leveraging React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, the app provides seamless interaction. Check it out and start sharing your thoughts!

## Features
- Create new blog posts
- Edit existing posts
- Delete unwanted posts
- User-friendly interface
